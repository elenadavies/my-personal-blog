I am a 2nd year student at the University of Bristol, currently studying History with Innovation and I'm really enjoying my course at the moment. I am learning lots of new transferable skills such as how to synthesise and present information, working within a team for a project with real world impact and also thinking of ways to implement sustainable human centred design. 
I am the Vice President of my university's Feminist Society. I have worked hard with my committee members in order to increase membership and profits as well as fulfil the wishes of our members. We have organised many socials just this year and collaboarted with other societies in order to grow our network and great a safe but fun space for our members. 

Millennial is a minimalist Jekyll theme.
