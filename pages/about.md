Hi! I'm El,

I am a 2nd year student at the University of Bristol, currently studying History with Innovation and I'm really enjoying my course at the moment. I am learning lots of new transferable skills such as how to synthesise and present information, working within a team for a project with real world impact and also ideation of ways to implement sustainable human-centred design. 

I am the Vice President of my university's Feminist Society. I have worked hard with my committee members in order to increase membership and profits as well as fulfil the wishes of our members. We have organised many socials just this year and collaborated with other societies in order to grow our network and create a safe but fun space for our members. 

This year I have also been a social secretary/events coordinator for a student-led feminist magazine called, That's What She Said (TWSS). I have organsied and hosted many events just this year. For example, our big launch event which doubled as an open mic night, movie nights, pottery painting, pub quizzes and more! 

I am half Bulgarian and really love being in touch with my mum's culture, I also speak a little bit of Spanish :)
My interests include going on long walks, camping, roadtrips to the beach and going to the gym!
