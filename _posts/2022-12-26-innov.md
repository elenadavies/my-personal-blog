Despite the numerous counts of people asking me what Innovation even is and why on earth would I do it with History as a degree... I feel that I have learnt so much! 

I feel comfortable collaborating across disciplines in all of my projects, remaining adaptable and ideating practical solutions even when things do not go our way. In our peojects we usually implement the Double Diamond Approach during the design process as it prevents designers from rushing into the prototyping stage.

My favourite part of the design process is usually conducting user research, it informs and guides my design ideas. I have found however that History deals with a lot of 'wicked' problems that often call for clumsy solutions, learning more about how the world we live in came to be is so important to me especially when we consider the socio-economic problems the world is currently facing. 

I hve found that I am very creative and love trying new things. From working in transdiscplinary groups, I have learnt and developed lots of new skills such as making a website, video editing, proper research, prototyping in a lab and more!
