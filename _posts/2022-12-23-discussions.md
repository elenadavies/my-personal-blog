Our discussion groups are integral to our society. They create a fair and safe environment in which we can discuss, debate and even share personal experiences with no judgement. We run them fortnightly and base each one on a different topic or question. The committee works together to create a powerpoint presentation backed up with facts and case studies to use as prompts to aid and guide the discussion. 

Some examples include: 
- Choice Feminism. Is any choice a woman makes inherently Feminist? Is Individualistic Feminism really progressive? 
- Feminism: Empowerment or Liberation?
- Internalised Misogyny

I also wanted to reach out to charities in Bristol in order to run a three part panel event on Healthy sex at university. We got professionals to come in and give educated talks on consent, contraception, and sexual health. 

We got such great feedback and all proceeds from the tickets went to charity!
