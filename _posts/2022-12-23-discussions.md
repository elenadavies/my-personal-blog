I am currently Vice president of my University's Intersectional Feminist Society (hoping to become president next for 3rd year!), I have been massively enjoying getting to know people with the same passion as mine but also love seeing the community grow here in Bristol! 

From the beginning I wanted to ensure that our society did the best we can to create a support network for female and non-binary students. I was a member of the society before I became Vice President and was dissatisfied with 

Making use of our large social media following, we sent out a survey asking our followers what they would like most out of the society for the year ahead. Results of the requests we received included: more social events, improved safety around the city, more discussion groups and educational/charity events with external speakers.
