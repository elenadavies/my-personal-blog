The results from our survery gave me the idea of running a self-defence session for only women and non-binary members to help combat feelings of danger. I reached out to the university's MMA society and arranged to meet to discuss a potential session. We weren't sure how much interest we would attract so we started off by paying the rent for just one session at a local MMA gym, sticking with the (free!) student instructors. 

We released tickets on the sports section of the SU wesbite and they sold out within a few hours! We also promoted the society's upcoming events regularly on our social medias. We received messages from our members who did not manage to buy tickets for the session, asking if there would be more. So, we decided that such high demand called for more and more sessions, until it became fortnightly for the rest of the term. 

Our feedback was very positive and invaluable to the team as a whole as we all collaborated to achieve such a great turnout. 

It was so inspiring to see how members gradually felt more and more comfortable as the sessions went on.
