I am currently Vice president of my University's Intersectional Feminist Society (hoping to become president next for 3rd year!), I have been massively enjoying not only spending time with and getting to know a group of people with the same passion as mine but also growing the community here in Bristol! 

From the beginning I wanted to ensure that our society did the best we can to create a support network for female and non-binary students. Making use of our large social media following, we sent out a survey asking our followers what they would like most out of the society for the year ahead. 

Results of the requests we received included: more social events, improved safety around the city, more discussion groups and educational/charity events with external speakers.
