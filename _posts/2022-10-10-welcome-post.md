Hello and welcome! I made this website to show my blog. Here, I will present my CV, Linkedin and projects. As a student currently studying History with Innovation at the University of Bristol, I am eager to gain experience in design and consulting.

I have experience with using design thinking concepts, Adobe creative suite, using programmes such as Mural/Miro to organise my work and conducting user research.
