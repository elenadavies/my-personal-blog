The magazine as a whole revolves around navigating life at university, Feminist responses to current affairs and opinion pieces. 
I am their events coordinator, my responsibilities include coming up with ideas for events, promotion, budgeting, organising locations and hosting them. 

It is mostly an online publication, however we produce an in print magazine once a year. The launch party of the print magazine is our most important event because it is a fantastic way to showcase creativity, get people together and improve membershipm profits. 

For the last launch party, I wanted to split up the room to have at least something that would appeal to all of our guests. We had an open mic section with lovely performances from poets, singers and musicians. Another section in which I set up mini market stalls where the local artists and creative students who I reached out to could set up shop and sell their beautiful artwork. Another section of the room had a female DJ playing funk and soul with a little dancefloor for a boogie. 

We try to remain as inclusive as possible in both our events and the types of articles we publish. Creating a safe space for people to have a creative outlet without judgement is important to us. This year responses to our commissions have significantly grown and so has readership! We hope to keep improving! :)
