Hello and welcome! I made this website to show my blog. Here, I will present my CV, Linkedin and projects. As a student currently studying History with Innovation at the University of Bristol, I am eager to gain experience in design and consulting.

I have experience with using design thinking concepts, Adobe creative suite, using programmes such as Mural/Miro to organise my work and conducting user research.

For this website, I found a Jekyll template I liked and used Github and visual code to write these posts and make it look pretty :) 
Frankly, I am very very new to coding but I have really enjoyed learning about it and making this!

All pics shown were created by me on Dalle- 2.
